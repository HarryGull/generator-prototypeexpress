From the default Yeoman Generator:

>Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

>Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*


To install Yeoman you will need to have npm (node packaged modules) installed. 

Once Node is installed you'll have access to npm so you can use this to install Yeoman.


```
$ npm install -g yo
```

The -g means that you are installing Yeoman globally. If you wish to uninstall Yeoman you can do so with this command.

```
$ npm uninstall -g yo
```


### Installing this generator

With Node and npm installed run this to install.

```
$ npm install -g generator-prototypeexpress
```


### Using this generator

With the generator installed it is time to run it. Create a directory on your computer somewhere and cd into it via the terminal. Then run:

```
$ yo generator-prototypeexpress
```
